# Sidechannel project

Sidechannel project aims to test synthetically the effectiveness of mitigations
against sidechannel information leaks. To make that possible, we are going to
build a test suite that robustly demonstrates information leaks across a
breadth of techniques (Meltdown, Spectre variants, L1TF, MDS, and those yet to
be discovered) and across a variety of isolation boundaries (same process,
user/kernel, VM guest/host, network).
